		<img src="giftapp.png" width="60%" title="Secret Giving wireframing" alt="gift giving"/>

			<p>Secret Giving is an app prototypr I created using FIgma. The idea is to create a wishliust that you share with others and when they purchase something, everyone but you can see it has been purchased. This allows for the gift reciver to be suprised and for anonyity.Thw wireframing shows all of the proccesses one can take when using the app. </p>
