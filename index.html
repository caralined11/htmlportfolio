		<p>Welcome to my site. My name is Caraline Dufrene and I am a uniqie soul. Im currently in school at <a href="https://txstate.edu" Texas State University target=_blank title= "Texas State University"> Texas State University.<a/>as a Digital Media student aspiring to be a UX/UI designer. I found my love for web design when I was a sophmore and switched degrees to make it happen. UX/UI design gives me the opportunity to be both creative visually while also using the data side of me to code and troubleshoot. Leaving the buisness school was an incredible decision.</p>

		<p>The most dreaded quetsion in an interview is when they ask, "tell me a little about you?" Maybe its just me but this is a LOADED question. So, ill try and answer that here. I grew up in Louisiana until I was seven years old. At that time I moved to Texas with my two siblings and parents. I've lived in north Dallas since then and really grew to love Texas. I personally love the heat in Texas. Theres nothing quite like going to the lake on a nice warm day and just feeling the breeze as you drive through the water. Oh man it would be nice to have a boat...</p>

		<p>I grew up as a PK (pastors kid) and I'm beyond grateful for that. I had so many opportunities to go outside the country and serve people as well as serve on the worship team at my home church. The foundation that my parents and church laid in me has guided all of my decisions. I am lucky to have found a church in San Marcos that I enjoy and I am even on the worship team here.</p>

		<p>When I'm not in school or church I like to do a handful of activites. The top of that list includes cooking new foods, playing disc golf, painting, writting music, playing games with my family, and binging tv. If I dont become a web deisgner, I would love to do something with nutrtion. There is a big gap between what people think a healthy lifestyle is and what it actually is. Working as a nutrionist would allow me to help others understand that they are not alone and that they can help their bodies run the way they were designed. </p>
