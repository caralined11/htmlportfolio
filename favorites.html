<p>In 2018 I went to Italy with my family. My brother had a terminal disease and Make-A-Wish sponsered us. We ate lots of homemade pasta, swam in beautiful oceans, walked around famous grounds, and saw masterpeices. I plan to go back to Italy one day to visit Tuscany and live the dream of being on a vinyard in Italy.</p>

<p> In 2017 my family and I went to New York City. We went after Christmas and ended up getting stuck in freezing weather. It just happened to be one of the coldest winters in in the past few years. However, we did manage to find some of my favorite restaurants in the United States. The list includes: <a href="https://jacobs.picklehospitality.com/" target="_blank" title= "Jacob's Pickle"> Jacob's Pickle<a/>, <a href="https://www.carminesnyc.com/locations/times-square" target="_blank" title= "Carmine's"> Carmine's Italian Restaurant<a/>, and <a href="https://taogroup.com/venues/tao-uptown-new-york/" target="_blank" title= "Tao"> Tao.<a/> </p>
